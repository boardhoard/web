Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M3fRcs2sKpffc7Yl1KXodvbBa5Q=/0x0/pic1798136.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eqDi6VPAU3XUvDDhqur97X2umO0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1798136.jpg",minPlayers:2,maxPlayers:6,playingTime:60,mechanics:["Card Drafting","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Route/Network Building"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1998,bggRating:6.53959,averageRating:6.73387,rank:849,designers:["Alan R.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace&quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/xFRII0rLyA7eb2CDF_GT4BS-eLE=/0x0/pic48605.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/hBDymMYGWKQNbiuxDtqSQyYZDvQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic48605.jpg",minPlayers:3,maxPlayers:4,playingTime:25,mechanics:["Roll / Spin and Move","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1998,bggRating:6.21801,averageRating:6.77597,rank:1501,designers:["Reinhard Staupe"],publishers:["F.X.

(source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/6Qod68Kgmb6NgXWdOglFnfAZiiE=/0x0/pic1000553.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/4zQbF0XfyuNPaiv8rPLyFV-Sbl8=/fit-in/200x150/pic1000553.jpg",minPlayers:2,maxPlayers:8,playingTime:120,mechanics:["Action / Movement Programming","Grid Movement","Modular Board","Simultaneous Action Selection"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1994,bggRating:6.9854,averageRating:7.10701,rank:365,designers:["Richard Garfield"],publishers:["Wizards of the Coast","999 Games","AMIGO","Avalon Hill Games, Inc.","Hasbro","Play Factory"],artists:["Peter Bergting","Bob Carasca","Phil Foglio","Daniel Gelon","Jennifer Lathrop","Paul Sottosanti","Franz Vohwinkel","Peter Whitley"],playerPollResults:[{numPlayers:1,best:0,recommended:4,notRecommended:166,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:8,recommended:56,notRecommended:146,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:3,best:16,recommended:137,notRecommended:57,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:4,best:90,recommended:123,notRecommended:11,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:5,best:149,recommended:72,notRecommended:7,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:6,best:145,recommended:66,notRecommended:11,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:7,best:56,recommended:109,notRecommended:40,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:8,best:52,recommended:106,notRecommended:46,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:8,best:6,recommended:15,notRecommended:113,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!0}],expansions:[{name:"RoboRally: Armed and Dangerous",gameId:1569},{name:"RoboRally: Crash and Burn",gameId:1968},{name:"RoboRally: Grand Prix",gameId:1967},{name:"RoboRally: King of the Hill",gameId:88354},{name:"RoboRally: Radioactive",gameId:1966}]},{gameId:19,name:"Wacky Wacky West",description:"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes!

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/CeJiWNodJGwBPse17RA6p4krH6c=/0x0/pic148345.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Lz-oN-BoiBvBrbZ9U94f8VrErnE=/fit-in/200x150/pic148345.jpg",minPlayers:1,maxPlayers:16,playingTime:240,mechanics:["Action / Movement Programming","Modular Board","Role Playing","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1979,bggRating:6.44256,averageRating:7.17234,rank:1007,designers:["Richard Hamblen"],publishers:["The Avalon Hill Game Co","Hobby Japan"],artists:["George Goebel","Kim Grommel","Richard Hamblen","Randall C.

The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Deluxe&quot; version had three expansions:&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Carrier War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the F&amp;E 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade.&#10;&#10;In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Federation & Empire: Advanced Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation & Empire: Module 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Special Operations and Federation & Empire: Module 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Marine Assault)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation & Empire: Carrier War)&#10;    Federation & Empire: Planetary Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: Strategic Operations&#10;    Federation & Empire: ISC War&#10;    Federation & Empire: Minor Empires&#10;&#10;&#10;Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &quot;couples&quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&#10;&#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/BUAACWD26gVVBxey8n4s-G15slw=/0x0/pic2606107.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/azshD1M11e0Z4nMe34T98zpbIz4=/fit-in/200x150/pic2606107.jpg",minPlayers:2,maxPlayers:2,playingTime:30,mechanics:["Hand Management","Set Collection"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1999,bggRating:7.06067,averageRating:7.15384,rank:301,designers:["Reiner Knizia"],publishers:["KOSMOS","999 Games","Albi","Competo / Marektoy","Devir","Filosofia \xc9ditions","Galakta","IELLO","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.","Laser plus","Midgaard Games","Piatnik","Playhouse Ltd","Rio Grande Games","Stupor Mundi","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Tilsit","Zvezda"],artists:["Vincent Dutrait","Grafik Studio Kr\xfcger","Michaela Kienle","Anke Pohl","Thilo Rick","Claus Stephan","Franz Vohwinkel"],playerPollResults:[{numPlayers:1,best:1,recommended:4,notRecommended:207,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:261,recommended:17,notRecommended:2,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:4,recommended:5,notRecommended:185,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!0}],expansions:[{name:"Lost Cities: Expedition 6 \u2013 The Lost Expedition",gameId:206374}]},{gameId:51,name:"Ricochet Robots",description:"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible.

The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.  Play continues with the cycling of civilizations until a certain score is reached, whereupon final rounds are played and a victor is determined.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Small World (released in March 2009)&#10;&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/r0XsQjm_m8NO74tH4MDZl1f6i3c=/0x0/pic168171.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Auql0I0NWfo3fpB8vtd9QC0KgtA=/fit-in/200x150/pic168171.jpg",minPlayers:3,maxPlayers:6,playingTime:90,mechanics:["Area Control / Area Influence","Area Movement","Variable Player Powers"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1999,bggRating:6.70385,averageRating:7.10986,rank:661,designers:["Philippe Keyaerts"],publishers:["Descartes Editeur"],artists:["Cyril Saint Blancat"],playerPollResults:[{numPlayers:1,best:0,recommended:4,notRecommended:38,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:0,recommended:7,notRecommended:40,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:3,best:8,recommended:39,notRecommended:8,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:4,best:40,recommended:19,notRecommended:0,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:5,best:19,recommended:34,notRecommended:5,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:6,best:3,recommended:21,notRecommended:29,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:6,best:0,recommended:0,notRecommended:35,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!0}]},{gameId:61,name:"Fossil",description:"On the hunt for petrified treasures, players are competing paleontologists trying to make as complete a set as possible of several fossils.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.&#10;&#10;The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.&#10;&#10;The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/mGR8fsicNTzCsHSQUkY4OQ-Zzdo=/0x0/pic1021646.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/vmQv0jGfRQiyXq9hNb2AQ0ZdtMU=/fit-in/200x150/pic1021646.jpg",minPlayers:2,maxPlayers:2,playingTime:60,mechanics:["Action / Movement Programming","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1982,bggRating:5.67217,averageRating:6.16672,rank:4643,designers:["Larry Harris, Jr."],publishers:["Citadel's Game Series (CGS)","Milton Bradley"],artists:[],playerPollResults:[{numPlayers:1,best:0,recommended:0,notRecommended:2,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:2,recommended:0,notRecommended:0,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:0,recommended:0,notRecommended:2,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!0}]},{gameId:97,name:"Conquest of the Empire",description:"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.

A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points.

America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special &quot;Star Wars&quot; laser relay systems that fire from space.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;",image:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/VzHd-4kiiopq5CwFIr_L3Tc3SM4=/0x0/pic3884550.jpg",thumbnail:"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/YkHeFtBgT5f4fftLFGUWDJO9pR4=/fit-in/200x150/pic3884550.jpg",minPlayers:2,maxPlayers:4,playingTime:180,mechanics:["Area Movement","Dice Rolling"],isExpansion:!1,yearPublished:1986,bggRating:6.24532,averageRating:6.70536,rank:1426,designers:[],publishers:["Milton Bradley"],artists:[],playerPollResults:[{numPlayers:1,best:0,recommended:4,notRecommended:22,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:2,best:23,recommended:13,notRecommended:2,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:3,best:2,recommended:25,notRecommended:9,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:4,best:27,recommended:8,notRecommended:2,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!1},{numPlayers:4,best:0,recommended:1,notRecommended:24,numPlayersIsAndHigher:!0}],expansions:[{name:"5th Column (fan expansion for Fortress America)",gameId:32619},{name:"Fortress America: Expansion Pack #1",gameId:13119},{name:"Fortress Illinois",gameId:27727}]},{gameId:101,name:"Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix",description:"This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.

When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.
